# Firestation-DSS
Emergency (e.g., medical / fire) response management systems have very stringent service level requirements. These are typically expressed in terms of coverage requirements. For instance, it may be stipulated that every district (such as a mahalle) is within 15 minutes of driving distance from a fire station or hospital. For the purposes of this project, we assume that Istanbul Buyuksehir Belediyesi (IBB) tasks us with re-designing the network of fire stations in Istanbul from scratch. That is, our team's objective is to determine a set of locations for the fire stations in Istanbul.
